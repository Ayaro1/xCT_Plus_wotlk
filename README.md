# xCT+ 3.7.1 backport 

by [Barsoom](https://forum.wowcircle.net/member.php?u=261041)

xCT+ is immensely based off the add-on xCT by braindump (aka Affli). It strives to be as minimalistic as possible while maintaining ease of use. That is why, introduced in version 3, you can now configure all settings while in-game.

Overall, xCT+ is a replacement for Blizzard’s scrolling combat text. It is superior to the default combat text because xCT+ organizes incoming healing, incoming damage, and outgoing damage/healing into their own frames, while minimizing spam.
 
# FEATURES

* Frames for tracking Criticals, Loot and Money, Spell Procs, Unit Power (Mana), and Class Combo Points
* A grid when positioning the frames
